## What Did I Do?
**For this project, I:**    
• Deployed web app that predicts the price of bitcoin from 2018 to August 2019, using the historical data of bitcoin from coinmarketcap.com.    
• Coded back end predict function using the dash library.   
• Upgraded 2 static graphs to plotly express graphs so that the user could modify which dates to look at.

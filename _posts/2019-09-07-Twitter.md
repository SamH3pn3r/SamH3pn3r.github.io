## What Did I Do?
**For this Project, I:**    
• Built a web app where a user can pit two twitter users against each other to see which is more likely to tweet any user-given-phrase.   
• Programmed the back end functions with Flask and the linear regression model using the basilica API.    
• Linked my app to the Twiter API using .env file to store the consumer key and access token.

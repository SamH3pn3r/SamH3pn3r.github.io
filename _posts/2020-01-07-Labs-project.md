Here is the link to my labs project: [Tagger](https://tagger-fe-revert.now.sh/)  
and here is a video showing how it works and what we did [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hWgtgHQWiy11NycB7RYzcqBwC4UybmxO/view) 

### What does it do?

It's an email client that automatically sorts your emails into 8 folders and has an improved search bar.  
Folders: Entertainment, Events, Finance, Productivity, Shopping, Social, Travel, Other.   

### What did you do on the project?

• Built an email client that sorted emails based on tags they were given (Travel, Social, Packages, and more).  
• Analyzed and tagged 10,000 to 20,000 emails to build a training/testing data set.   
• Deployed 3 machine learning models through Amazon Elastic Beanstalk.

Here is the link to my first labs project: [Tagger](https://taggerhq.com)  
  
Since we use the Gmail API, the sign-in is not as smooth as we would have liked.   
You'll get a pop-up that exclaims, "This app isn't verified."

To continue to our application, click advanced and then click "Go to taggerhq.com."  

![Step two](https://github.com/SamH3pn3r/SamH3pn3r.github.io/blob/master/img/Annotation%202020-01-07%20121744%20(2).jpg)   

If you have 2-step verification set-up, you should get a notification on your phone or in your email where you'll need to confirm
that you are the one signing in.  
  
Thank you for taking the time to check out the project.

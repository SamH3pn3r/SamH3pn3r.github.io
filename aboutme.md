# Hello!    
My name is Samuel Hepner.       
I graduated from the University of Washington in June 2019 and I've spent the past 9 months at Lambda School. 
## What is Lambda School for Data Science?   
Lambda School is a 9+ month computer science & software engineering program that provides an immersive hands-on curriculum with a track       focused on Data Science.   
## What did you do at Lambda School for Data Science?   
I learned the skills necessary to become a data scientist by attending classes M-Th, tests on Fridays, Build Week projects, and a Labs Project.   
**Build week projects** are to be completed in **one week**.    
**Labs project** took **two months**.   
If you want to look at my projects, there is the projects tab in the top right and/or the link to my GitHub is [here](https://www.github.com/samuelhepner).   

While attending Lambda School, I've been reading the Witcher saga and I'm currently on the 3rd book (no spoilers please!).       

## What is the Witcher saga?    
If you frequent Netflix, you probably saw it. If you didn't realize they were books, I highly recommend you check [them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Witcher) out.   
I am a owner of bitcoin and a massive nerd.   
## What is Bitcoin?   
It's the most popular cryptocurrency which means it's barely known about unless you have a family member that won't stop talking about it    or you're interested in finance.   

My favorite superhero: Deadpool   
## Who is Deadpool?   
He's a Marvel "superhero". He's well known for breaking the forth wall and for his references to the Golden Girls.    
You can read all about him [here](https://superheroes.fandom.com/wiki/Deadpool)  

My favorite video game: Halo, Bioshock, and Doom(2016)    
## What is Halo, Bioshock, and/or Doom(2016)?   
All three are First Person Shooters(FPS) with incredible campaigns, backgrounds/worlds, and they are all gory.    
I was first introduced to Halo when I was 5 years old, I was introduced to Bioshock when I was 13/14 years old, and I was introduced to     Doom when I was 17 years old.    
If you are interested in video games and you haven't heard about them (I don't know how), you can read about them here: [Halo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_(franchise)), [Bioshock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BioShock), and [Doom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(franchise))

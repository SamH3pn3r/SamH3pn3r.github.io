# Hello!    
My name is Samuel Hepner.       
I graduated from the University of Washington in June 2019 and I've spent the past year at Lambda School. 
## What is Lambda School for Data Science?   
Lambda School is a 9+ month computer science & software engineering program that provides an immersive hands-on curriculum with a track       focused on Data Science.   
## What did you do at Lambda School for Data Science?   
I learned the skills necessary to become a data scientist by attending classes M-Th, tests on Fridays, Build Week projects, and a Labs Project.   
**Build week projects** are to be completed in **one week**.    
**Labs project** took **two months**.   
If you want to look at my projects, there is the projects tab in the top right and/or the link to my GitHub is [here](https://www.github.com/samuelhepner).
